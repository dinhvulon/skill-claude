description: Run comprehensive code analysis and generate expert Markdown reports for security, performance, and quality assessment. Analyzes Python and React/JS/TS code with detailed findings and actionable recommendations.
---

You are an expert code analyzer. When the user runs `/analyzer <file-path>`, you MUST:

## Step 1: Run Automated Analysis
```bash
cd .claude/smart-code-analyzer/scripts
python quick_analyze.py react <file-path>
```

This will create a timestamped folder in `assets/` with automated reports.

## Step 2: Activate Project & Read Code
```
1. Use mcp__serena__activate_project to activate 'tokyo_chauffeur_web_hotel'
2. Use mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview to understand file structure
3. Use mcp__serena__find_symbol to read the main component/function with include_body=true
```

## Step 3: Create Expert Manual Review Report

After analyzing the code semantically, create a comprehensive Markdown report in the timestamped assets folder named `EXPERT_REVIEW.md` with:

### Report Structure:

```markdown
# [Component Name] - Expert Code Review

**File:** `<file-path>`
**Analysis Date:** <timestamp>
**Automated Report:** `./SUMMARY.md`

---

## Executive Summary

**Automated Analysis Results:**
- Performance: X issues (High: X, Medium: X, Low: X)
- Security: X issues (High: X, Medium: X, Low: X)
- Quality: X issues (High: X, Medium: X, Low: X)

**Expert Manual Review:**
- Found X additional issues not detected by automated tools
- Total: X issues requiring attention

---

## 🔴 HIGH Priority Issues

### 1. [Issue Title]
- **Location:** `file.tsx:line-number`
- **Code:**
```typescript
// Show problematic code snippet
```
- **Problem:** Clear description of what's wrong
- **Risk:** What could go wrong
- **Fix:**
```typescript
// Show corrected code
```

## 🟡 MEDIUM Priority Issues

[Same format as HIGH]

## 🟢 LOW Priority Issues

[Same format]

---

## 📈 Performance Impact Estimation

| Issue | Current | After Fix | Savings |
|-------|---------|-----------|---------|
| [Issue] | [Current state] | [Optimized state] | ~X% |

---

## 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ [Task] (X min)

### This Week
1. [Task] (X min)

### Next Sprint
1. [Task] (X hours)

---

## 📝 Code Quality Metrics

```
Lines of Code: X
Cyclomatic Complexity: Low/Medium/High
Function Count: X
Hook Usage: X
Dependencies: X imports
```

---

*Generated by Expert Manual Review + Smart Code Analyzer*
```

## Step 4: Present Summary to User

Show the user:
1. Link to timestamped folder
2. Top 3-5 most critical issues
3. Estimated time to fix HIGH priority issues
4. Ask if they want you to create a PR with fixes

## Important Rules:

- ALWAYS use `quick_analyze.py` first (not individual analyzers)
- ALWAYS read code with serena semantic tools for deep analysis
- ALWAYS create `EXPERT_REVIEW.md` in the assets timestamp folder
- Focus on issues automated tools miss (React patterns, hooks, memory leaks)
- Provide actionable fixes with code examples
- Estimate time and performance impact

## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Full Project Analysis

```bash
cd .claude/smart-code-analyzer/scripts

# Step 1: Run all React analyzers
python react_performance_analyzer.py ../../../src > react_perf.json
python react_security_analyzer.py ../../../src > react_sec.json
python react_quality_analyzer.py ../../../src > react_qual.json

# Step 2: Generate reports
python generate_md_report.py react_perf.json reports/performance.md react-performance
python generate_md_report.py react_sec.json reports/security.md react-security
python generate_md_report.py react_qual.json reports/quality.md react-quality
```

---

### Workflow 2: Quick Component Check

```bash
cd .claude/smart-code-analyzer/scripts

# Analyze specific component
python react_performance_analyzer.py ../../../src/components/Layout > layout_analysis.json

# Generate report
python generate_md_report.py layout_analysis.json layout_report.md react-performance

# View report
cat layout_report.md
```

---

### Workflow 3: CI/CD Integration

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# analyze.sh - Run in CI pipeline

cd .claude/smart-code-analyzer/scripts

# Run analysis
python react_performance_analyzer.py ../../../src > /tmp/analysis.json

# Generate report
python generate_md_report.py /tmp/analysis.json /tmp/report.md react-performance

# Check for critical issues
CRITICAL_ISSUES=$(jq '.summary.severity_breakdown.high' /tmp/analysis.json)

if [ "$CRITICAL_ISSUES" -gt 5 ]; then
  echo "FAILED: Too many critical issues ($CRITICAL_ISSUES)"
  exit 1
fi

echo "PASSED: Analysis complete"
```

---

## Output Examples

### Console Output
```
[OK] Markdown report generated: sidebar_analysis_report.md
[INFO] Analysis type: react-performance
[INFO] Total issues: 13
```

### Report Sample

See generated report at: `.claude/smart-code-analyzer/scripts/sidebar_analysis_report.md`

Key sections:
- 🔴 **1 High Priority** - Memory leaks (setTimeout cleanup)
- 🟡 **8 Medium Priority** - Missing React.memo, heavy imports
- 🟢 **4 Low Priority** - Inline functions, large files

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Analysis
- Run analysis before commits
- Integrate into pre-commit hooks
- Schedule weekly full project scans

### 2. Prioritize Issues
- Fix HIGH severity first
- Address MEDIUM issues in sprints
- Track LOW issues as technical debt

### 3. Incremental Improvements
- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Set realistic goals per iteration
- Measure progress over time

### 4. Team Collaboration
- Share reports with team
- Discuss findings in code reviews
- Use as learning opportunities

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Unicode errors on Windows
**Solution:** Fixed in v1.0.1 - uses ASCII-safe output

### Issue: Analysis too slow
**Solution:**
- Analyze specific directories instead of entire project
- Skip test files with proper .gitignore patterns
- Use `node_modules` exclusion patterns

### Issue: Too many issues reported
**Solution:**
- Focus on one analyzer at a time
- Set baseline and track improvements
- Use severity filters to prioritize
